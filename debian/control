Description: Dev files for C++ library implementing Chunked Producer/Consumer for NDN
 The Named Data Networking (NDN) project aims to develop a new Internet
 architecture that can capitalize on strengths — and address weaknesses — of
 the Internet’s current host-based, point-to-point communication
 architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of
 communication. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms
 data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data
 container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust
 in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable
 communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth.
